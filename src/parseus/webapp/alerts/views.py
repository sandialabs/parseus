    This builds the client lazily on first use and reuses it so keep-alive works.

    A client that raised is discarded and rebuilt on the next poll rather than

    Lifecycle under concurrency. Under ASGI a poll runs in a worker thread, and a

    :meth:`close` routinely arrives while :meth:`fetch` is still mid-query.
    Closing the client at that moment breaks the running query ("Pool is closed")
    and makes the datastore transport retry it and mark the node dead. So
    :meth:`close` never closes a client that a fetch is using: it marks the
    source closed and the *last party out* (the finishing fetch, or ``close``
    itself when nothing is running) releases the client, exactly once.

    The stream loop awaits each poll before starting the next, so at most one
    fetch runs at a time; that is what makes a single client safe to share.
