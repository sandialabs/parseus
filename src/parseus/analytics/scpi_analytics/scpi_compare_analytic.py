    Name: ScpiCompareAnalytic

    How: Compares the set of SCPI command codes seen during current operation
         against a baseline day of normal operation, reporting command codes
         that were added or removed. The comparison is membership-based and
         ignores command order; the baseline day with the fewest differences is
         chosen for reporting.

    When: Detect end device or SCPI communication that might be compromised.
